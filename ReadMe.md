# Fruit Loops
## Background:
Fruit Loops is a browser based demo/ game based on the functionality of a drum pad/loop machine. 
It allows users to make simple beats or music that can loop infinitely.

## Functionality:
In Fruit Loops, users will be able to:
 
    • Select an instrument (fruit) and choose from the instrument's available sounds.
    • Select a tile (or tiles) on the loop board to fill it with the selected sound.
    • Remove a sound from the board by clicking the tile again.
    • Start the loop playing-through the sounds placed on the board.
    • Stop the loop playing.

Bonus functionality if there's time:

    • tempo changes
    • user can control how long the loop is (1-4 measures, with added measures coming in as separate rows below)
    • saving audio file to user's machine
    • user can drag playhead to a different spot
    • user-uploaded sounds


In addition, this project will include:
    
    • Instructions that guide a user on how to interact with the page.
    • A Readme describing project details.
    • Animation to show where a playhead is and what sounds are currently playing.
    • Hover effects to suggest clickable items.
    • A demo of a pre-filled loop to show how it can be used.

The only library I plan to use is Canvas, to make shapes on the page
